# Full-Text Search in JavaScript

The following repository contains the implementation of a search engine based on `Okapi BM25`, a ranking function representing a modern approach for query searches and document retrieval based on `TF-IDF` term scoring.

The motivation is to understand what composes text search and how search as a service (e.g. Google) and as software products (e.g Elasticsearch) use certain algorithms to optimise their search capabilities.
